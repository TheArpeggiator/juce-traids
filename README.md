juce-triads
=========

Use of the JUCE framework to create simple, event-driven triads.

Implementation Basics
---------

Use of JUCE framework keyboard keypress detection, mouse movement detection and mouse keypress detection to generate random midi values in a major-triad.
Use of simple midi-freq formula to get respective frequencies for each sine wave oscillator.
Each sine wave has been added to each other to obtain final major triad.
