juce-triads
=========

Use of the JUCE framework to create simple, event-driven triads.

Implementation Basics
---------

Use of JUCE framework keyboard keypress detection, mouse movement detection and mouse keypress detection to generate random midi values in a major-triad.
Use of simple midi-freq formula to get respective frequencies for each sine wave oscillator.
Each sine wave has been added to each other to obtain final major triad.

Steps
-----
First press key on keyboard, then move the mouse, then click mouse button (for effective triad magic!).
Pressing the keyboard key resets all the sine wave oscillators so start with that first (I'll make it more functional soon!).
